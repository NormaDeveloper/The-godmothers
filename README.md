This repository includes the group project of Module 1 of the Web Development bootcamp of Adalab, a Front-End development course focused on women without previous programming knowledge.

This project has been carried out by 5 students and it has been our first collaborative website developed. For this we have created a website with the social information of all team members.

The website consists of several pages:

1. A Home page with the main information about the 5 members of the team.

2. Use of mediaqueries and other responsive design techniques so that the web adapts to the screen size of different devices
3. Handling of Slack, GitHub, GitHub projects, GitHub pages, VSCode, Gulp, Terminal, Zeplin.

- <h4 align="left">Working methodology:</h4>

1. Planning and executing projects under the Scrum/Agile framework.
2. Using git for project version control as a team
3. Publishing the result to the Internet using GitHub Pages
4. Implementation of Scrum as a reference framework for product development, always based on Agile values as key points of teamwork and continuous improvement
5. Fluid communication among team members

   All pages have a header and a footer. In the header appears the name of the team and a navigation menu that remain fixed at the top of the window when scrolling. At the bottom of the page appears the copyright, another menu and the Adalab logo.

   On the main page, it appears a photo with the claim of the team. A "Team" section with its description and our strengths and weaknesses, a "About us" section with summarized information on each member team: name, photo, short bio and social links (Twitter, LinkedIn, GitHub and email).

   On the contact page there will be a form that collects contact information such as full name, email, phone and message, and a button to submit it.

The main and contact pages have an established design. The design is made for 3 device sizes:

1. Mobile, under 768px
